## DonatelloPyzza

DonatelloPyzza is a simple and educational game to help beginners learn Python in high school and university.

A turtle can move through a grid and touch each cells until it finds the pizza.
This game can be used at several levels:
- for young beginners: they can hard-code a path to help the turtle find its pizza and small mazes.
- for beginners: they can develop intuitive heuristics to find the pizza
- for intermediate or advanced developers: they can develop a complex path finding method or AI-based solutions.

## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`pip install donatellopyzza`


## Getting started

First, import the right modules to run the game:

```python
from donatellopyzza import Game
from donatellopyzza import Action
from donatellopyzza import Feedback
```

`Game` is a class that you will use to create a game instance.

Let's create the game and its environment:

```python
# specify the name of the maze
__ENVIRONMENT__ = "maze"
# display the interface (or not)
__GUI__ = True

game = Game(__ENVIRONMENT__, __GUI__)
# returns a turtle that execute actions on its environment
turtle = game.start()
```

Once the game has started, you get a turtle instance which you can move around the board.
To do this, the following instruction can be used:

```python
feedback = turtle.execute(Action.FORWARD)
print(feedback)
```

You can use the feedback from the `execute()` method to see what happened after your action.

## Learning the rules:  actions and feedbacks

`Action` and `Feedback` define the different actions and feedbacks types. You can use the following actions in your code:

    Action.MOVE_FORWARD -> make your turtle go one step forward
    Action.TURN_RIGHT -> your turtle will turn on its right
    Action.TURN_LEFT -> on its left
    Action.TOUCH -> the turtle will touch the cell in front of it to know its type


Depending on your action, the game can provide you one of the following feedback:

    Feedback.COLLISION -> you just tried to walk in a wall !
    Feedback.MOVED -> you successfully moved
    Feedback.MOVED_ON_PIZZA -> your turtle is on the pizza (congratulation!)
    Feedback.TOUCHED_WALL -> you just touched a wall
    Feedback.TOUCHED_NOTHING -> the touched cell is empty (no wall, no pizza, you can walk on it)
    Feedback.TOUCHED_PIZZA -> the turtle touched the pizza


## Generating and save your own mazes

`Maze` is a class used to generate and save new mazes. You can retrieve saved maze by their names as indicated in example files. A new maze is generated (and save) as follow:

```python
from donatellopyzza import MazeGenerator

generator = MazeGenerator()
maze = generator.create_maze(10, 10)
fn = "test"
maze.save(maze, filename=fn)
```


For more details, you can find several complete examples of the game loop in the `examples` folder on the github repository of this project.

Have fun!

## Roadmap

- make several tests for this package
- make tutorials to help beginners use this package
- make a more formal documentation
- promote this game through a website
- ~~adapt the GUI to resize it depending on the number of cells~~
- ~~add a test infrastructure to validate users' algorithm on several mazes~~
- ~~make possible to the user to select the difficulty its maze when generating it~~
- ~~debug the GUI~~
- ~~add a gridworld generator~~
